## util.types

<br />

Provide Type Checker as `util.types` and provide alternatives to userland modules  
that would currently rely on `process.binding('util')`.

### Proposals

- [node-eps: Add 'types' module to core](https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps/pull/44)
- [TC39: Builtin.is and Builtin.typeOf](https://github.com/jasnell/proposal-istypes)
