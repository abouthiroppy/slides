## postcss

Use [reporter](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-reporter), [browser-reporter](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-browser-reporter), [smart-import](https://github.com/sebastian-software/postcss-smart-import), [mixins](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-mixins) and [cssnext](https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext) plugins.  
see: [postcss.config.js](https://github.com/abouthiroppy/slides/blob/master/postcss.config.js)  
Love cssnext.😍  
This time, created common values and mixins because all slides will be included this repository.😏
