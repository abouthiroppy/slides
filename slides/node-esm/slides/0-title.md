こんにちは！
"こんにちは" means "hello" in English.

First, Thanks to all the Dublin engineers for inviting me.
I have been living in Dublin for one month now and I feel very comfortable.

In fact, I am giving this speech in English for the first time in my life.
So I am very very getting nervous, but I'll do my best.

Today, I would like to talk about ECMAScript Modules of Node.js.

BTW, Node.js v12 was released on 23rd April!!!
In addition, Node.js v6 will be End-of-life on 30th April.
This is very good news.
